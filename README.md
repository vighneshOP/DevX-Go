# DevX Studio (Beta)

DevX Studio is a **Python-powered UI builder** created using [Flet](https://flet.dev).  
It allows users to **design applications without coding knowledge** by simply guiding the AI step-by-step.  

This is the **first beta release** of DevX Studio.  
⚠️ Expect bugs and slow loading on startup — these will be improved in later versions.

## ✨ Features
- Full UI built with Python(Flet GUI).  
- Packaged into a **standalone EXE** (no dependencies needed).  
- Cross-platform concept (designed for Windows, but source can be adapted).  
- Users can edit, remix, and redistribute under the MIT License.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Run the EXE file — no installation required.  
2. The app loads the **UI designer**.  
3. You can **draw / add elements**, explain what you want, and the system generates the app for you.  
4. Save and export your work easily.
